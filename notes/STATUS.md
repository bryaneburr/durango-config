# Durango Status Log

## 2025-11-04 — Session Notes

- Scaffolded new Durango package with tooling, docs skeleton, and CI workflow.
- Implemented core modules (config manager, sources, utils, exceptions) plus Google-style docstrings.
- Added pytest coverage for precedence, environment parsing, and file loaders; `uv run pytest` passing.
- Adjusted precedence to anchor on model defaults, added automatic config file creation, and scrubbed repository-specific references.
- Added AGENTS guides for config, sources, and utilities modules.
- Next session: extend documentation, finalize release metadata, and draft publishing workflow.
